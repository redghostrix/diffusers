ðŸ¤— Diffusers provides pretrained diffusion models across multiple modalities, such as vision and audio, and serves
as a modular toolbox for inference and training of diffusion models.

More precisely, ðŸ¤— Diffusers offers:

- State-of-the-art diffusion pipelines that can be run in inference with just a couple of lines of code (see [src/diffusers/pipelines](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/src/diffusers/pipelines)).
- Various noise schedulers that can be used interchangeably for the prefered speed vs. quality trade-off in inference (see [src/diffusers/schedulers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/src/diffusers/schedulers)).
- Multiple types of models, such as UNet, that can be used as building blocks in an end-to-end diffusion system (see [src/diffusers/models](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/src/diffusers/models)).
- Training examples to show how to train the most popular diffusion models (see [examples](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/examples)).

## Definitions

**Models**: Neural network that models **p_Î¸(x_t-1|x_t)** (see image below) and is trained end-to-end to *denoise* a noisy input to an image.
*Examples*: UNet, Conditioned UNet, 3D UNet, Transformer UNet

**Schedulers**: Algorithm class for both **inference** and **training**.
The class provides functionality to compute previous image according to alpha, beta schedule as well as predict noise for training.
*Examples*: [DDPM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239), [DDIM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02502), [PNDM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09778), [DEIS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13902)

**Diffusion Pipeline**: End-to-end pipeline that includes multiple diffusion models, possible text encoders, ...
*Examples*: GLIDE, Latent-Diffusion, Imagen, DALL-E 2

## Philosophy

- Readability and clarity is prefered over highly optimized code. A strong importance is put on providing readable, intuitive and elementary code desgin. *E.g.*, the provided [schedulers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/src/diffusers/schedulers) are separated from the provided [models](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/src/diffusers/models) and provide well-commented code that can be read alongside the original paper.
- Diffusers is **modality independent** and focusses on providing pretrained models and tools to build systems that generate **continous outputs**, *e.g.* vision and audio.
- Diffusion models and schedulers are provided as consise, elementary building blocks whereas diffusion pipelines are a collection of end-to-end diffusion systems that can be used out-of-the-box, should stay as close as possible to their original implementation and can include components of other library, such as text-encoders. Examples for diffusion pipelines are [Glide](https://github.com/openai/glide-text2im) and [Latent Diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion).

## Quickstart

### Installation

**Note**: If you want to run PyTorch on GPU on a CUDA-compatible machine, please make sure to install the corresponding `torch` version from the 
[official website](https://pytorch.org/).
```
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers.git
cd diffusers && pip install -e .
```

### 1. `diffusers` as a toolbox for schedulers and models.

`diffusers` is more modularized than `transformers`. The idea is that researchers and engineers can use only parts of the library easily for the own use cases.
It could become a central place for all kinds of models, schedulers, training utils and processors that one can mix and match for one's own use case.
Both models and schedulers should be load- and saveable from the Hub.

For more examples see [schedulers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/src/diffusers/schedulers) and [models](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/src/diffusers/models)

#### **Example for [DDPM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239):**

```python
import torch
from diffusers import UNetModel, DDPMScheduler
import PIL
import numpy as np
import tqdm

generator = torch.manual_seed(0)
torch_device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"

# 1. Load models
noise_scheduler = DDPMScheduler.from_config("fusing/ddpm-lsun-church", tensor_format="pt")
unet = UNetModel.from_pretrained("fusing/ddpm-lsun-church").to(torch_device)

# 2. Sample gaussian noise
image = torch.randn(
    (1, unet.in_channels, unet.resolution, unet.resolution),
    generator=generator,
)
image = image.to(torch_device)

# 3. Denoise
num_prediction_steps = len(noise_scheduler)
for t in tqdm.tqdm(reversed(range(num_prediction_steps)), total=num_prediction_steps):
    # predict noise residual
    with torch.no_grad():
        residual = unet(image, t)

    # predict previous mean of image x_t-1
    pred_prev_image = noise_scheduler.step(residual, image, t)

    # optionally sample variance
    variance = 0
    if t > 0:
        noise = torch.randn(image.shape, generator=generator).to(image.device)
        variance = noise_scheduler.get_variance(t).sqrt() * noise

    # set current image to prev_image: x_t -> x_t-1
    image = pred_prev_image + variance

# 5. process image to PIL
image_processed = image.cpu().permute(0, 2, 3, 1)
image_processed = (image_processed + 1.0) * 127.5
image_processed = image_processed.numpy().astype(np.uint8)
image_pil = PIL.Image.fromarray(image_processed[0])

# 6. save image
image_pil.save("test.png")
```

num_inference_steps = 50
eta = 0.0  # <- deterministic sampling

for t in tqdm.tqdm(reversed(range(num_inference_steps)), total=num_inference_steps):
	# 1. predict noise residual
	orig_t = noise_scheduler.get_orig_t(t, num_inference_steps)
	with torch.no_grad():
	    residual = unet(image, orig_t)

	# 2. predict previous mean of image x_t-1
	pred_prev_image = noise_scheduler.step(residual, image, t, num_inference_steps, eta)

	# 3. optionally sample variance

import PIL.Image
import numpy as np
import torch

model_id = "fusing/ddim-celeba-hq"

model = UNetModel.from_pretrained(model_id)
scheduler = PNDMScheduler()

ddpm = PNDM(unet=model, noise_scheduler=scheduler)

# run pipeline in inference (sample random noise and denoise)
with torch.no_grad():
    image = ddpm()

# process image to PIL

```

#### **Text to Image generation with Latent Diffusion**

_Note: To use latent diffusion install transformers from [this branch](https://github.com/patil-suraj/transformers/tree/ldm-bert)._

```python
from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline

ldm = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("fusing/latent-diffusion-text2im-large")

generator = torch.manual_seed(42)

prompt = "A painting of a squirrel eating a burger"
image = ldm([prompt], generator=generator, eta=0.3, guidance_scale=6.0, num_inference_steps=50)

image_processed = image.cpu().permute(0, 2, 3, 1)
image_processed = image_processed  * 255.
image_processed = image_processed.numpy().astype(np.uint8)
image_pil = PIL.Image.fromarray(image_processed[0])

# save image
image_pil.save("test.png")
```

 #### **Text to speech with BDDM**

_Follow the isnstructions [here](https://pytorch.org/hub/nvidia_deeplearningexamples_tacotron2/) to load tacotron2 model._

```python
import torch
from diffusers import BDDM, DiffusionPipeline

torch_device = "cuda"

# load the BDDM pipeline
bddm = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("fusing/diffwave-vocoder-ljspeech")

# load tacotron2 to get the mel spectograms
tacotron2 = torch.hub.load('NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples:torchhub', 'nvidia_tacotron2', model_math='fp16')
tacotron2 = tacotron2.to(torch_device).eval()

text = "Hello world, I missed you so much."

utils = torch.hub.load('NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples:torchhub', 'nvidia_tts_utils')
sequences, lengths = utils.prepare_input_sequence([text])

# generate mel spectograms using text
with torch.no_grad():
    mel_spec, _, _ = tacotron2.infer(sequences, lengths)

# generate the speech by passing mel spectograms to BDDM pipeline
generator = torch.manual_seed(0)
audio = bddm(mel_spec, generator, torch_device)

# save generated audio
from scipy.io.wavfile import write as wavwrite
sampling_rate = 22050
wavwrite("generated_audio.wav", sampling_rate, audio.squeeze().cpu().numpy())
```
