# Diffusers for other modalities

Diffusers offers support to other modalities than vision and audio.
Currently, some examples include:
- [Diffuser](https://diffusion-planning.github.io/) for planning in reinforcement learning (currenlty only inference): [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TmBmlYeKUZSkUZoJqfBmaicVTKx6nN1R?usp=sharing)

If you are interested in contributing to under-construction examples, you can explore:
- [GeoDiff](https://github.com/MinkaiXu/GeoDiff) for generating 3D configurations of molecule diagrams [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1pLYYWQhdLuv1q-JtEHGZybxp2RBF8gPs?usp=sharing).
