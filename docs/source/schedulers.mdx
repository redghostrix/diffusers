# Schedulers

The base class ['SchedulerMixin'] implements low level utilities used by multiple schedulers.
At a high level:
- Schedulers are the algorithms to use diffusion models in inference as well as for training. They include the noise schedules and define algorithm-specific diffusion steps.
- Schedulers can be used interchangable between diffusion models in inference to find the preferred tradef-off between speed and generation quality.
- Schedulers are available in numpy, but can easily be transformed into PyTorch.

## API

- Schedulers should provide one or more `def step(...)` functions that should be called iteratively to unroll the diffusion loop during
the forward pass.
- Schedulers should be framework-agonstic, but provide a simple functionality to convert the scheduler into a specific framework, such as PyTorch
with a `set_format(...)` method.

## Examples

- The ['DDPMScheduler'] was proposed in [Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239) and can be found in [scheduling_ddpm.py](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/src/diffusers/schedulers/scheduling_ddpm.py).
An example of how to use this scheduler can be found in [pipeline_ddpm.py](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/src/diffusers/pipelines/pipeline_ddpm.py).
- The ['DDIMScheduler'] was proposed in [Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02502) and can be found in [scheduling_ddim.py](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/src/diffusers/schedulers/scheduling_ddim.py). An example of how to use this scheduler can be found in [pipeline_ddim.py](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/src/diffusers/pipelines/pipeline_ddim.py).
- The ['PNDMScheduler'] was proposed in [Pseudo Numerical Methods for Diffusion Models on Manifolds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09778) and can be found in [scheduling_pndm.py](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/src/diffusers/schedulers/scheduling_pndm.py). An example of how to use this scheduler can be found in [pipeline_pndm.py](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/src/diffusers/pipelines/pipeline_pndm.py).
