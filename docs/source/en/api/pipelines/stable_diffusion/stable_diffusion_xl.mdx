# Stable diffusion XL

Stable Diffusion 2 is a text-to-image _latent diffusion_ model built upon the work of [Stable Diffusion 1](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release). 
The project to train Stable Diffusion 2 was led by Robin Rombach and Katherine Crowson from [Stability AI](https://stability.ai/) and [LAION](https://laion.ai/).

*The Stable Diffusion 2.0 release includes robust text-to-image models trained using a brand new text encoder (OpenCLIP), developed by LAION with support from Stability AI, which greatly improves the quality of the generated images compared to earlier V1 releases. The text-to-image models in this release can generate images with default resolutions of both 512x512 pixels and 768x768 pixels. 
These models are trained on an aesthetic subset of the [LAION-5B dataset](https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/) created by the DeepFloyd team at Stability AI, which is then further filtered to remove adult content using [LAIONâ€™s NSFW filter](https://openreview.net/forum?id=M3Y74vmsMcY).*

For more details about how Stable Diffusion 2 works and how it differs from Stable Diffusion 1, please refer to the official [launch announcement post](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-v2-release).
